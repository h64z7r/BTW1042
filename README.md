Scenario: 
'No Madonna Fan'Expects Show at Ticket Time, Singer Says 
By Lauren Berg
Law360 (April 4, 2024,   10:13 PM EDT)
Madonna, Live Nation, and the Barclays Center have asked a New York federal   judge   to dismiss a lawsuit alleging fans were   "lulled" into buying tickets for   a   show   that   started   two hours late, stating no reasonable concertgoer — "and certainly no Madonna   fan" —   expects   the headliner to begin at the ticketed time. 
Michael   Fellows   and   Jonathan   Hadden   accused   the   three   defendants   of   breaching   their contracts with concertgoers, false advertising, and unfair trade practices after the   singer   didn't   show up to her Celebration Tour concerts at the Brooklyn arena until   after   10:30 p.m. when the shows were advertised to   start at   8:30 p.m. 
The defendants argued that neither of   the plaintiffs alleged the singer's performance was subpar or worth less than they paid, or that they left the   concert before it was   over.   They   also   didn't   seek   arefund   before   filing   the   lawsuit. 
What's more, the time printed on the ticket was 8:30 p.m., but nowhere did the defendants   advertise that Madonna would take the stage at that time, according to the motion.
Additionally,   "no reasonable concertgoer — and certainly no Madonna   fan — would expect   the headline act at a major arena concert to take the   stage   at the ticketed   event   time,"   the defendants said.
Fans got exactly what they   paid for: a   "full-length, high-quality   show" by   Madonna.   In   fact,   the day after the show, Hadden posted on Facebook   that he has   "never missed   a Madonna tour" and that the concert was   "incredible, as   always!"
Hadden and Fellows can't plausibly allege that concertgoers were deceived   or deprived   of what they paid for, and the suit   should be dismissed.
The pair filed their lawsuit on Jan.   17, alleging that they and   other   fans   "were   lulled   into   purchasing tickets for concerts at the Barclays Center to be put on by one   of   the premier performers of   the past 40 years," with the defendants first delaying the shows   from   July to December due to the singer's illness and then   promising an   8:30 p.m.   start time. "By the time of   the concerts' announcements, Madonna had demonstrated flippant difficulty    in ensuring a timely or complete performance, and defendants were   aware   that   any   statement   as to a start time for a show   constituted,   at best,   optimistic   speculation,"   Fellows   and   Hadden   said.
Fellows bought one ticket for $155 and Hadden bought two tickets   for   $292 to   attend Madonna's Dec.   13 show. All   three tickets state that the performance was slated   for   8:30   p.m., but Fellows and Hadden said the singer didn't   appear   on   stage until   almost   11 p.m. 
The pair allege that Madonna has a   "long history" of   tardy performances, including starting   concerts more than two hours late in Boston and Washington, on the   current   Celebration Tour.
The pair want to represent three classes: one for people who bought a ticket for the   concerts         through   Ticketmaster, a   second   for   people   who   bought   a   ticket   through   areseller   that   is   not Ticketmaster or the box office at the venue, and a third   for   those   who bough代 写BTW1042 Business Law - Research AssignmentR

They estimate there are thousands of   such class members.
In the motion to dismiss, Madonna and the other defendants   argue the plaintiffs   also haven't   plausibly alleged they suffered any injury.
"Plaintiffs speculate that ticketholders who left the venue after   1 a.m. might   have had   trouble   getting a ride home or might have needed to wake up early the next day for work," the defendants said.   "That is not a cognizable   injury."
"But even if   it were, plaintiffs do not allege that they suffered it,"   they   added.   "Indeed, plaintiffs do not plead any injury that they themselves suffered by spending   the night   at an   'incredible' concert." 
"This is not a lawsuit about fans who were disturbed   that   they had to   stay up   late,"   Corwin said.   "This is about thousands of   fans who had to leave the Madonna concerts   in   the middle   of   her   performance, after   paying   good   money   for   their   tickets   because   either   public transportation was closing, as well as the public garages in which their   cars   were parked,   or   they had commitments to babysitters or work, and did not expect   an   8:30   show to   end   after      midnight, particularly   with   no   opening   or   supporting   artist." 
"If   Madonna was not going to perform. on time, she should have   changed   her performance   time on her tickets from   8:30 to   10:30 like she did   in   2019,"   the   attorney   said.
